So, on the second attempt I parse a js script in HTML doc.

So, the result is json file with a structure like: {position_in_list: {ip_adress, port}}.
"position_in_list" is an integer, added to sort the list of data from top to bottom.

Json file has name 'data.json' and situated in spider's directory
